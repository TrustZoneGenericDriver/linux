* when the function returns and the decoder functions cannot be

*
* The most common causes for an error occurring before the command reaches the
* service are:\n
*  The encoder ran out of space – error returned is OTZ_ERROR_ENCODE_MEMORY.\n
*  The service does not exist – error returned is OTZ_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.\n
*  The system rejects a new session due to bad login credentials – error
*  return is OTZ_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.\n
*  The operation has timed out, or been cancelled; error return is
*  OTZ_ERROR_CANCEL.\n
*  The secure environment is busy or low on resource and cannot handle 
*  the request.\n
*
*  For open and invoke operations, if the operation reaches the service, but the
*  service returns an error, then otz_operation_perform 
*  returns OTZ_ERROR_SERVICE. The error code from the service
*  is assigned to  *pui_service_return. \n
*
*  Unlike the case where a system error occurs, the service
*  can return a message: the operation transitions to the 
*  state OTZ_STATE_DECODE and the decoder functions can be used.\n
*
*  For open and invoke operations, if the operation succeeds then
*  otz_operation_perform returns OTZ_SUCCESS and
*  the value OTZ_SUCCESS is also assigned to *pui_service_return. The operation
*  transitions to the state OTZ_STATE_DECODE and the client can use the decoder 
*  functions to retrieve the message, if present, from the service.\n
*  
*  For close operations the service cannot return a structured message, and the
*  operation will always transition to OTZ_STATE_INVALID. 
*  The decoder functions cannot be used on a close operation.
*  A close operation cannot be performed while the session has other operations 
*  open, or has allocated shared memory blocks – this results in
*  UNDEFINED behavior.\n

/**
* @brief Appends a reference of previously allocated shared block to the encoded

* when the operation is released. A shared memory block cannot be released 
* while is it still referenced in an operation. Once a memory reference 
* has been created the client must not read from, or write to, 
* the referenced range until the reference is destroyed.
*
* Some implementations of the secure environment may not be able to implement 
* genuine shared memory and/or may make use of device hardware

* OTZ_MEM_SERVICE_WO: The service can only write to the memory block.\n

* when the block was created using otz_shared_memory_allocate, 
* otherwise the encoder error OTZ_ERROR_ENCODE_FORMAT will be raised.
*
* If an error occurs, for example if there no more space in the encoder buffer 
* or the range lies outside of the memory block, this function sets 
* the error state of the encoder. Additionally, there is a restriction 
* whereby the client cannot have multiple concurrent references to any address
